Introduction
This document provides an overview of Apache Airflow, its core components, and a step-by-step guide to deploying Airflow on a Kubernetes cluster using the Kubernetes executor.

Understanding Apache Airflow
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform for programming and managing workflows. It provides a programmatic way to author, schedule, and monitor workflows. Airflow is used to create, schedule, and monitor workflows.

Core Components
DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs): These represent the workflow as a series of tasks with dependencies.
Tasks: Individual units of work within a DAG.
Scheduler: Continuously monitors the DAGs and triggers tasks according to their schedule.
Executor: Responsible for running the tasks.
Webserver: Provides a UI for managing and monitoring workflows.

Kubernetes Executor
The Kubernetes executor is a powerful option for running Airflow tasks on Kubernetes. It creates a new pod for each task instance, providing isolation between the tasks and resource management.
It also provides integration with Kubernetes ecosystem
