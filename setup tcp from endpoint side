To configure the endpoint service to receive commands over TCP, you'll need to develop or modify the service to implement the necessary TCP server functionality. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

1. Choose a programming language and framework: Select a programming language and framework that best suits your requirements for the endpoint service. Common choices include Python, Java, Node.js, or C++.

2. Set up a TCP server: Create a TCP server within your chosen programming language and framework. This typically involves creating a socket, binding it to a specific IP address and port, and listening for incoming connections.

3. Accept incoming connections: Implement logic to accept incoming connections from clients. This involves waiting for client connections and accepting them when they arrive.

4. Receive and process commands: Once a client connection is established, you can receive commands from the client over the TCP connection. Read data from the socket and process it according to your application's requirements.

5. Send responses: After processing a command, you may need to send a response back to the client. Use the socket connection to send the response data.

6. Handle multiple clients (optional): If your service needs to handle multiple clients simultaneously, you can implement threading or asynchronous mechanisms to handle multiple connections concurrently.

7. Implement error handling and security: Add appropriate error handling to handle network errors or unexpected data. Additionally, consider implementing security measures, such as authentication and data validation, to ensure the integrity and security of the communication.

8. Test and deploy: Thoroughly test your endpoint service to ensure it functions as expected. Once you're satisfied with the testing, deploy the service to your desired production environment.

Please note that the specific implementation details and code examples will vary depending on the programming language and framework you choose. You should consult the documentation and resources available for your chosen technology stack to learn the specifics of creating a TCP server in that context.
