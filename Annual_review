Adoption of New Technologies:

Proactively expanded your knowledge base by acquiring expertise in cutting-edge observability tools such as Black-box Exporters, SNMP Exporters, Prometheus Agent, and Grafana configuration using PromQL queries. This expanded toolkit significantly enhanced our observability capabilities.
Advanced Monitoring Solutions:

Successfully implemented and fine-tuned Black-box Exporters and SNMP Exporters, providing us with comprehensive visibility into the health and performance of critical systems, applications, and network devices within the MKS cluster.
Leveraged Prometheus Agent to enable more granular and efficient data collection, contributing to improved alerting and troubleshooting capabilities.
Grafana Expertise:

Demonstrated proficiency in Grafana configuration, utilizing PromQL queries to create customized and insightful dashboards. These dashboards have become instrumental in visualizing key performance metrics and aiding in data-driven decision-making.
Log Management with Loki and Fluentbit:

Successfully integrated Loki and Fluentbit into our observability stack, enhancing our log management capabilities. This integration has streamlined log collection, storage, and analysis, making it easier to pinpoint and address issues quickly.
Migrating and Productionizing Products:

Led the effort to migrate and productionize several critical products and services within the MKS production cluster. This achievement contributed to the organization's operational excellence and scalability, ensuring the seamless functioning of these products in a production environment.






Slide 1:
Exporters play a crucial role in collecting metrics and data from various sources. They collect and expose metrics in a format Prometheus can scrape
Blackbox exporter: Probes endpoints over HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, TCP, and ICMP, providing insights into service health
SNMP exporter: Monitors network devices and systems using SNMP, enabling monitoring of network performance and health
Custom exporters: Includes KV check exporters (scraping endpoints as Key-Value pairs), SNMP traps, and Exts file check exporters for customized monitoring needs
Prometheus: Prometheus is a monitoring system and time series database that collects metrics from monitored targets, allowing for real-time querying, visualization, and alerting based on those metrics.
Prometheus is the core monitoring and alerting server that collects and stores metrics as time series data.
Loki: Log aggregation system
Grafana: Visualization and dashboard tool


Slide 2: Implementation Details
Prometheus agent: Prometheus agents are configured to scrape data from diverse sources using multiple exporters and  efficiently manage and forward metrics to Prometheus servers
Remote write: Data collected by Prometheus agents and fluent-bit is securely transmitted through API to ESM-managed Prometheus for centralized storage and analysis.


PagerDuty is an incident management platform that helps teams detect, triage, and resolve issues 
Loki : A log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It enables efficient collection, querying, and exploration of logs
Tempo: A open-source distributed tracing system, enables efficient storage, querying, and visualization of trace data to help understand the performance and behavior of distributed systems.
